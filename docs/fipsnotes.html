	    <h3>FIPS What?  Where Do I Start?</h3>

	    <ul>

	      <li>OpenSSL itself is not validated.  Instead
	      a special carefully defined software component called the
	      OpenSSL FIPS Object Module has been created.  This Module was
	      designed for compatibility with OpenSSL so that products using
	      the OpenSSL API can be converted to use validated cryptography
	      with minimal effort.</li>

	      <li>The OpenSSL FIPS Object Module validation 
	      is "delivered" in source code form, meaning that if you can use it 
	      exactly as is and can build it (according to the very specific documented
	      instructions) for your platform, then you can use it as
	      validated cryptography on a "vendor affirmed" basis.</li>

	      <li>If even the tiniest source code or build process changes are
	      required for your intended application, you cannot use the open
	      source based validated module directly.  You must obtain your
	      own validation.</li>

	    </ul>

	    <p>Note that FIPS 140-2 validation is a complicated topic that the
	    above summary does not adequately address.  You have been
	    warned!</p>

	    <h3>Current Validations</h3>

	    <p> The most recent open source based validation is the FIPS 140-2
	    certificate <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm#1747">#1747</a>.
	    You will need the <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140sp/140sp1747.pdf">Security Policy</a>
	    and <a href="/source/openssl-fips-2.0.tar.gz">source</a>
	    at a minimum. And did we mention the
	    <a href="fips/UserGuide.pdf">User Guide</a>?</p>

            We are not currently taking on any additional validation work
            nor adding new platforms to the existing "1747" validation.
