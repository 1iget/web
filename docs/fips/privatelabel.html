	  <header><h2>OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Private Label Validations</h2></header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p> If you haven't already, please read our <a
	      href="/docs/fipsnotes.html">FIPS 140-2 Notes</a> page.</p>

	    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The addition of multiple new
	    formal requirements since the #1747 validation was first approved
	    in 2012, and recent unfavorable experiences with increasingly
	    unpredictable outcomes from the validation process, have increased
	    to the point where private label validations are no longer
	    economically feasible for a small organization of limited means;
	    the risk doesn't justify the substantial investment of time and
	    money required to pursue new validations. As of 2015 we are no
	    longer performing any private label validations. The addition of
	    new platforms to the existing #1747 or <a
	      href="https://openssl.com/fips/ransom.html">comparable</a>
	    validations is still possible and those validation actions are still
	    being performed.</p>

	    <p>The rest of this page is of historical interest only.</p>

	    <h3>What It Is</h3>

	    <p>We have found that one of the most popular commercial services
	    offered by the OpenSSL team is the <a
	      href="/docs/fipsnotes.html#privatelabel">private label validation</a>.
	    It's not a business we ever planned to be in, but as the
	    originators of the source code based OpenSSL FIPS Object Module
	    validations, and with lots of practice, we've gotten pretty good
	    at it. The revenue we earn from these validations supports the
	    OpenSSL project, and for some validations also results in useful
	    additions to the OpenSSL baseline.</p>


	    <h3>What You Get</h3>

	    <p>For a total fixed price we will obtain a Level 1 FIPS 140-2
	    validation in your name using the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module v2.0
	    for two common platforms using unmodified source code.  A common
	    platform is a computing device (hardware and operating system)
	    that is available and familiar to us and the test lab(s).
	    Examples of common platforms are:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Microsoft Windows (32 bit) on x86 hardware</li>
	      <li>Microsoft Windows (64 bit) on x64 hardware</li>
	      <li>Linux on 32 bit x86 hardware</li>
	      <li>Linux (64 bit) on x64 hardware
	      <li>The Android operating system on some common smart phones
	      using ARM processors</li>
	      <li>HP-UX 11 on Itanium</li>
	      <li>Solaris on x64 hardware </li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>Additional common platforms can be added to your validation for
	    US$4000 (Linux/Unix/Android) or US$4500 (desktop/server Windows)
	    each.</p>

	    <p>We will handle all interaction with the accredited testing lab
	    and the <a
	      href="https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/index.html">CMVP</a>.
	    You sign one contract with the OSF with half of the price due as a
	    down payment and the remainder due only when your certificate is <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm">posted</a>
	    by the CMVP.</p>

	    <p>Within two weeks of executing your contract with us, your
	    pending validation will also appear on the <a
	      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/inprocess.html">pre-val list</a>.
	  The presence of your product on this list is sufficient
	to satisfy FIPS 140-2 requirements for some procurements.</p>

	    <h3>What Qualifies</h3>

	    <p>This turnkey validation package is applicable in the following
	    circumstances:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>You have already confirmed that the module generated from
	      the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module v2.0 source distribution,
	      possibly with modifications, works on your platform(s).</li>
	      <li>Your modifications to the OpenSSL source code, if any, are
	      not "cryptographically significant".  Roughly speaking, that
	      means the modifications do not affect the actual cryptographic
	      algorithms.  Modifications for portability, such as changing
	      <em>#include</em> statements or redefining macros, or changes to
	      the build process such as new compiler or linker options, are
	      generally acceptable.</li>
	      <li>Your application does not require cross-compilation (the
	      build system and the target platform can be the same system),
	      <em>or</em> your cross-compiled platform is one for which the
	      complete build process, including generation of the integrity
	      test digest, is already known and tested.</li>
	      <li>The actual platform, hardware and software, is either
	      already available to the OSF and the lab or is supplied by you.
	      We will need at least two complete sets of platform hardware and
	      software for customer provided equipment.  This equipment can be
	      returned once the validation is awarded, though some customers
	      have preferred to leave that equipment with us for regression
	      testing of future revisions.</li?
	      <li>You have determined that the performance of the module is
	      satisfactory on your specific target platform.  We continually
	      make performance enhancements to OpenSSL, only some of which can
	      readily be incorporated into routine private label
	      validations.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Note that we can still help you if not all of these
	    circumstances apply, but we'll have to look at your specific
	    situation more closely. Note minor software modifications can
	    often be accommodated in a change letter modification.</p>
