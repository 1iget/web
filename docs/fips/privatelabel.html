	    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The addition of multiple new
	    formal requirements since the #1747 validation was first approved
	    in 2012, and recent unfavorable experiences with increasingly
	    unpredictable outcomes from the validation process, have increased
	    to the point where private label validations are no longer
	    economically feasible for a small organization of limited means;
	    the risk doesn't justify the substantial investment of time and
	    money required to pursue new validations. As of 2015 we are no
	    longer performing any private label validations.
	    </p>

            <p>We will be starting work on a new FIPS validation soon.</p>
