    The latest of the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module ("FIPS module")
    FIPS 140-2 validations saw the introduction of a new requirement
    by the CMVP:
    <blockquote>
      <em>The distribution tar file, shall be verified using an
        independently acquired FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic
        module...</em>
    </blockquote>
    Some prospective users of the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 2.0 already
    have ready access to an existing securely-installed software product
    using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography that is capable of calculating
    the HMAC-SHA-1 digest of a file on disk, in which case satisfying this
    requirement is easy (simply calculate the HMAC-SHA-1 digest of the
    source distribution file using the key <code>"etaonrishdlcupfm"</code>
    and confirm it is that same as documented in the <a
      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm">Security Policy</a>
    document (e.g., <code>"2cdd29913c6523df8ad38da11c342b80ed3f1dae"</code> for
    <em>openssl-fips-2.0.tar.gz</em>).
    </p>

    <p>For most prospective users the identification, acquisition,
    installation, and configuration of a suitable product may be a challenge.
    (See Section 6.6 of our FIPS
    <a href="/docs/fips/UserGuide-2.0.pdf">User
      Guide</a>)
    The requirement for this verification with an independently acquired
    FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module does not apply when the
    distribution file is distributed using a "secure" means. Distribution
    on physical media is considered secure in this context so you can
    verify by obtaining a copy of the distribution files on CD-ROM disks via
    postal mail.</p>

    <p>OpenSSL are not providing disks directly at this time.  However we have
    an arrangement with KeyPair Consulting who will
    <a href="https://keypair.us/2018/05/cd/">send a disk to you at no
      charge</a>.</p>

    <p>Note that the files you will receive on these CDs will be
    <em>identical</em> in every respect (except for formal FIPS 140-2
    compliance) with the files you can download from <a
      href="/source/">https://www.openssl.org/source/</a>
    Once the distribution files have been received on this CD
    they can be redistributed internally within an organizational
    entity (corporation, institution, or agency) by normal means.
