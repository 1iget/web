OpenSSL Security Advisory [28 Aug 2017]
========================================

Malformed X.509 IPAdressFamily could cause OOB read (CVE-2017-3735)
===================================================================

Severity: Low

If an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension,
OpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread. The most likely result
would be an erroneous display of the certificate in text format.

As this is a low severity fix, no release is being made. The fix can be
found in the source repository (1.0.2, 1.1.0, and master branches) in
the X509v3_addr_get_afi function.  This bug has been present since 2006.

This issue was found by Google's OSS-Fuzz project on August 22.
The fix was developed by Rich Salz of the OpenSSL development team.
