  OpenSSL version 0.9.8 Beta 1
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The first beta is now released.
  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-0.9.8-beta1.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: edcfbc90cc125a184b88a01bb52c0e08
      SHA1 checksum: 531350515eed47290f50087320fe78176ab1d5a7

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.8-beta1.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-0.9.8-beta1.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 103 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Some changes aren't quite complete at this time.  Most notably, the
  use of BN_ULLONG in crypto/pqueue and the DTLS files doesn't work on
  some platforms, for example some 64-bit systems (those using the
  SIXTY_FOUR_BIT BIGNUM macro).

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
