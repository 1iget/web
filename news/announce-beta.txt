  OpenSSL version 0.9.8 Beta 2
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The second beta is now
  released.  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and
  FTP from the following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you
  can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-0.9.8-beta2.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: 2c1c0958500a6c4e63b5c13f0f5d0694
      SHA1 checksum: bbe0460154099506484affb49d40ccaefe6ef3d2

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.8-beta2.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-0.9.8-beta2.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 103 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Since the first beta, the following has happened:

    - the build system has been corrected for systems where the first
      beta was failing.  Enhancements for Cygwin are the most
      notable.
    - some more platforms have 'no-sse2' by default.
    - there are better checks to see if SHA-512 is built (it won't
      build on systems that have no support for 64-bit integers).
    - a memory leak in PKCS#7 has been plugged.
    - ECDH and ECDSA have a few enhancements.

  We still have problems with BN_ULLONG in crypto/pqueue and the DTLS
  files.  It's being worked on.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
