  OpenSSL version 0.9.8 Beta 5
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The fifth beta is now
  released.  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and
  FTP from the following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you
  can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-0.9.8-beta5.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: 4b492a622ca39f0c444c3cabc330933d
      SHA1 checksum: 3524b04490491e1d1674363fac601cd4b002d471

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.8-beta5.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-0.9.8-beta5.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 104 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES
  and http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/NEWS).

  Since the fourth beta, the following has happened:

    - Changed -m486 to -march=i486 in Configure.
    - Added a new NetWare target that uses BSD sockets.
    - Propagate INSTALL_PREFIX to inner Makefiles.
    - Make it possible to read files larger than 2GB with the FILE
      BIO.
    - Enhance cipher suite parsing.
    - Other bug fixes...

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.

  The OpenSSL Project Team...
