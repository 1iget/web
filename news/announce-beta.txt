  OpenSSL version 1.0.1 Beta 3
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle. The third beta is now released.
  This is expected to be the final beta depending on the number of bugs
  reported.

  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.1-beta3.tar.gz
      Size: 4451351
      MD5 checksum: dc141587e0d374bdb0c7b97f770fff5e
      SHA1 checksum: 32105cbcc1bc6bc959102b2d70eb16ed1da732ce

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.1-beta3.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.1-beta3.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 55 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Also check the latest snapshots at ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/ 
  or CVS (see http://www.openssl.org/source/repos.html) to avoid
  reporting previously fixed bugs.

  Since the second beta the following has happened:

    - Improved TLS v1.2 client authentication interop.
    - MDC2 signature format compatibility fix.
    - ABI compatibility fixes.
    - Other fixes.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team.
