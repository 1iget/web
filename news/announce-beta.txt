  OpenSSL version 1.0.0 Beta 1
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The first beta is now released.
  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.0-beta1.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: 49f265d9dd8dc011788b34768f63313e
      SHA1 checksum: 89b4490b6091b496042b5fe9a2c8a9015326e446

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.0-beta1.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.0-beta1.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 107 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.

  Oh and to those who have noticed the date... the joke is that it
  isn't a joke.

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team...
