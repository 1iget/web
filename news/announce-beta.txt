  OpenSSL version 1.0.1 Beta 1
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle. The first beta is now released.

  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.1-beta1.tar.gz
      Size: 4445727
      MD5 checksum: 2501e8caf6724c5ad747ac0d6df00c3d
      SHA1 checksum: a97fd63356a787e9ddc9f157ce4b964459a41f40

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.1-beta1.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.1-beta1.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 52 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Also check the latest snapshots at ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/ 
  or CVS (see http://www.openssl.org/source/repos.html) to avoid
  reporting previously fixed bugs.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
