  OpenSSL version 1.0.1 Beta 2
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle. The second beta is now released.

  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.1-beta2.tar.gz
      Size: 4447371
      MD5 checksum: ef66ad92539014e1a8fe33bdd8159bad
      SHA1 checksum: b92b1d3c019d094bc5b3079dfd60acc2bf925b53

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.1-beta2.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.1-beta2.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 52 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Also check the latest snapshots at ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/ 
  or CVS (see http://www.openssl.org/source/repos.html) to avoid
  reporting previously fixed bugs.

  Since the first beta the following has happened:

    - Avoid handshake failures by fixing heartbeat support.
    - Security fixes from stable releases.
    - Other fixes.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team.
