  OpenSSL version 1.0.0 Beta 3
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle. The third beta is now released.
  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.0-beta3.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: cf5a32016bb9da0b9578099727bf15c9
      SHA1 checksum: 5cff6cf7b91b75a6e70e3c3d8bd169eacd851c00

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.0-beta3.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.0-beta3.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 116 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).


  Since the second beta, the following has happened:

    - Several DTLS fixes and updates including ECDHE support.
    - Fixes and updates to cryptodev.
    - Fix verify parameter inheritance.
    - Deprecate MD2 algorithm.
    - GOST ENGINE and interop fixes.
    - Build system fixes.
    - Other bug fixes.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
