  OpenSSL version 1.0.0 Beta 4
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle. The fourth beta is now released.
  This is expected be the final or penultimate beta depending on the number
  of bugs reported.

  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-1.0.0-beta4.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: TBA
      SHA1 checksum: TBA

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-1.0.0-beta4.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-1.0.0-beta4.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible. This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 120 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Also check the latest snapshots at ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/ 
  or CVS (see http://www.openssl.org/source/repos.html) reporting previously
  fixed bugs.

  Since the third beta, the following has happened:

    - Initial TLS session renegotiation fix
    - TLS ticket and SNI coexistance fix
    - Several DTLS fixes and updates.
    - Custom OCSP headers.
    - Check return values properly on some functions.
    - Some documentation for X509 chain verification functions.
    - Time routines fixed for CRL generation.
    - Additional PRNG duplication protection.
    - Cross compilation updates.
    - Build system fixes including VMS.
    - Other bug fixes.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
