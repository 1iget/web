  OpenSSL version 0.9.8 Beta 3
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The third beta is now
  released.  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and
  FTP from the following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you
  can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-0.9.8-beta3.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: 5353f8c553c3be6835180bfdeb31b5dc
      SHA1 checksum: a8c3624e1dd5fd797fc5e58ea7d0def361fa26e2

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.8-beta3.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-0.9.8-beta3.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 104 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES
  and http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/NEWS).

  Since the second beta, the following has happened:

    - the build system has been corrected for systems where the second
      beta was failing.  These contain enhancements for VMS and DJGPP.
    - there has been work to make pqueue and dtls more portable
    - RSA-PSS and RSA-X.931 have been added.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.
