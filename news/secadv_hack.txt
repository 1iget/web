Website defacement: provisional details.
==========================================

Last updated: 1st January 2014

On Sun 29th December 2013 at around 1am GMT the home page of www.openssl.org
was defaced.  We restored the home page just after 3am GMT and started 
forensics, investigation, and recovery.

Initial investigations show that the attack was made via hypervisor through
the hosting provider and not via any vulnerability in the OS configuration.
Steps have been taken to protect against this means of attack in future.

The source repositories have been checked and they were not affected.
Other than the modification to the index.html page no changes to the
website had been made.

More details to follow.
