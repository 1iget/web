Website defacement: provisional details.
==========================================

Initial investigations show that the attack was made via hypervisor through
the hosting provider and not via any vulnerability in the OS configuration.
Steps have been taken to protect against this means of attack in future.

The source repositories have been checked and they were not affected.
Other than the modification to the index.html page (which was restored a
few minutes after we became aware of the attack) no changes to the website had
been made.

More details to follow.
