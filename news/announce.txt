   OpenSSL version 0.9.8e and 0.9.7m released
   ==========================================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 0.9.8e of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a feature and bugfix release and incorporates
   enhancements and bugfixes to the toolkit.  For a complete list of
   changes, please see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES.

   The 0.9.8e release includes RFC3779 support and several cipher
   selection bugfixes.

   We also release 0.9.7m, which is the first full release of OpenSSL
   which can be linked against the validated FIPS 1.1.1 module.

   We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8e to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 0.9.8e is available for
   download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you
   can find the various FTP mirrors under
   http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

     * http://www.openssl.org/source/
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

   For those who want or have to stay with the 0.9.7 series of
   OpenSSL, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7m
   as soon as possible.  It's available in the same location as
   0.9.8e.
