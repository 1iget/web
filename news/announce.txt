   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 1.0.1b of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a new feature release. For a complete

   The most significant changes are:

      o Fix compilation error on non-x86 platforms.
      o Make FIPS capable OpenSSL ciphers work in non-FIPS mode.

   We consider OpenSSL 1.0.1b to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 1.0.1b is available for
