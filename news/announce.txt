   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 0.9.8j of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a critical security, feature and bugfix release.

   This is the first full release of OpenSSL that can link against the
   validated FIPS module version 1.2

   We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8j to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 0.9.8j is available for
   download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you
   can find the various FTP mirrors under
