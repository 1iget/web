   OpenSSL version 1.0.0 released
   ==============================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 1.0.0 of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new
   OpenSSL version is a major release and incorporates many new
   features as well as major fixes compared to 0.9.8n.  For a complete
   list of changes, please see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES .

   The most significant changes are:

      o RFC3280 path validation: sufficient to process PKITS tests.
      o Integrated support for PVK files and keyblobs.
      o Change default private key format to PKCS#8.
      o CMS support: able to process all examples in RFC4134
      o Streaming ASN1 encode support for PKCS#7 and CMS.
      o Multiple signer and signer add support for PKCS#7 and CMS.
      o ASN1 printing support.
      o Whirlpool hash algorithm added.
      o RFC3161 time stamp support.
      o New generalised public key API supporting ENGINE based algorithms.
      o New generalised public key API utilities.
      o New ENGINE supporting GOST algorithms.
      o SSL/TLS GOST ciphersuite support.
      o PKCS#7 and CMS GOST support.
      o RFC4279 PSK ciphersuite support.
      o Supported points format extension for ECC ciphersuites.
      o ecdsa-with-SHA224/256/384/512 signature types.
      o dsa-with-SHA224 and dsa-with-SHA256 signature types.
      o Opaque PRF Input TLS extension support.
      o Updated time routines to avoid OS limitations.

   We consider OpenSSL 1.0.0 to be the best version of OpenSSL available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
   soon as possible.  OpenSSL 1.0.0 is available for download via HTTP
   and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
   FTP mirrors under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

     * http://www.openssl.org/source/
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
