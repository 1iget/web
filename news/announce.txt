  OpenSSL version 0.9.4 released
  ===============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of version
  0.9.4 of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new OpenSSL version
  incorporates over 50 changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete
  list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  The most significant changes are:

    o Transparent support for PKCS#8 format private keys: these are used by
      several software packages and are more secure than the standard form
    o PKCS#5 v2.0 implementation
    o Password callbacks have a new ``void *'' argument for application data
    o Avoid various memory leaks
    o New pipe-like BIO that allows using the SSL library when actual I/O
      must be handled by the application (BIO pair)

  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.4 to be the best version of OpenSSL available and
  we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of old SSLeay
  versions, upgrade as soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.4 is available for
  download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (the various
  FTP mirrors you can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team...
