  The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
  version 0.9.7f of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new
  OpenSSL version is a bugfix release and incorporates changes and
  bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete list see

  The most significant changes are:

    o Several compilation issues fixed.
    o Many memory allocation failure checks added.
    o Improved comparison of X509 Name type.
    o Mandatory basic checks on certificates.
    o Performance improvements.

  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.7f to be the best version of OpenSSL available
  and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
  soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.7f is available for download via HTTP
  and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
  FTP mirrors under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

      MD5 checksum: b2d37d7eb8a5a5040d834105d5ae1a50
