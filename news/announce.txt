  ===============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of version
  0.9.3 of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new OpenSSL version
  incorporates over 90 changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete
  list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  The most significant changes are:

    o Lots of enhancements and cleanups to the Configuration mechanism
    o RSA OEAP related fixes
    o Added `openssl ca -revoke' option for revoking a certificate
    o Source cleanups: const correctness, type-safe stacks and ASN.1 SETs
    o Source tree cleanups: removed lots of obsolete files
    o Thawte SXNet, certificate policies and CRL distribution points
    o Preliminary (experimental) S/MIME support
    o Support for ASN.1 UTF8String and VisibleString
    o Full integration of PKCS#12 code
    o Sparc assembler bignum implementation, optimized hash functions
    o Option to disable selected ciphers

  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.3 to be the best version of OpenSSL available and
  we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of old SSLeay
  versions, upgrade as soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.3 is available for
  download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (the various
  FTP mirrors you can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The OpenSSL Project Team...
