  OpenSSL version 0.9.7c and 0.9.6k released
  ==========================================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
  version 0.9.7c of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new
  OpenSSL version is a security and bugfix release and incorporates
  changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete list see 
  http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES ).

  We also release 0.9.6k, which contains the same security bugfix as
  0.9.7c and a few more small bugfixes compared to 0.9.6j.

  For more details of the security issues being fixed in this release
  please see http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt

  The most significant changes are:

    o Security: fix vulnerabilities in ASN.1 parsing
      CAN-2003-0543, CAN-2003-0544                            [0.9.7c & 0.9.6k]
    o Security: fix additional vulnerability in ASN.1 parsing
      CAN-2003-0545                                                    [0.9.7c]
    o Only accept a client cert if the server requests one    [0.9.7c & 0.9.6k]
    o Various S/MIME bug and compatibility fixes                       [0.9.7c]

  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.7c to be the best version of OpenSSL available
  and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
  soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.7c is available for download via HTTP
  and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
  FTP mirrors under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  For those who want or have to stay with the 0.9.6 series of OpenSSL,
  we strongly recommend that you upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.6k as soon as
  possible.  It's available in the same location as 0.9.7c.
