   OpenSSL version 0.9.8d and 0.9.7l released
   ==========================================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 0.9.8d of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a security and bugfix release and incorporates
   changes and bugfixes to the toolkit.  For a complete list of
   changes, please see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES.

   This release fixes four security vulnerabilities, CVE-2006-2937,
   CVE-2006-2940, CVE-2006-3738, CVE-2006-4343.  Please see
   http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20060928.txt

   We also release 0.9.7l, which contains the security update and
   bugfixes compared to 0.9.7k.

   We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8d to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 0.9.8d is available for
   download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you
   can find the various FTP mirrors under
   http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

     * http://www.openssl.org/source/
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

   For those who want or have to stay with the 0.9.7 series of
   OpenSSL, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7l
   as soon as possible.  It's available in the same location as
   0.9.8d.
