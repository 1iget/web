   OpenSSL versions 1.0.0d and 0.9.8r released
   ===========================================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   versions 1.0.0d and 0.9.8r of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.
   These are security and bugfix releases; the most significant change:

      o Fix for security issue CVE-2011-0014
        [http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20110208.txt]

   For a longer list of changes, please see

       http://openssl.org/news/changelog.html.

   We consider OpenSSL 1.0.0d to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. Users of the 0.9.8 branch who are
   not ready to upgrade to the 1.0.0 branch should upgrade to
   OpenSSL 0.9.8r.

   OpenSSL 1.0.0d and 0.9.8r are available for download via HTTP and
   FTP from the following master locations (you can find various
   mirrors under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

     * http://www.openssl.org/source/
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
