<h1>Announcement: OpenSSL version 0.9.6e released</h1>

OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS<br>
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>

<p>
The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of version
0.9.6e of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new OpenSSL version
is a security- and bugfix release and incorporates several changes to
the toolkit (for a complete list see <a
href="http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES">http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES</a>).

<p>
The most significant changes are:

<ul>
  <li>Important security related bugfixes.
  <li>Various SSL/TLS library bugfixes.
</ul>

<p>
We consider OpenSSL 0.9.6e to be the best version of OpenSSL available
and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.6e is available for download via HTTP
and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
FTP mirrors under <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html">http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html</a>):

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/">http://www.openssl.org/source/</a>
    <li><a href="ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/">ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/</a>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="1">[1]</a> OpenSSL comes in the form of two distributions this time.
The reasons for this is that we want to deploy the external crypto device
support but don't want to have it part of the "normal" distribution just
yet.  The distribution containing the external crypto device support is
popularly called "engine", and is considered experimental.  It's been
fairly well tested on Unix and flavors thereof.  If run on a system with
no external crypto device, it will work just like the "normal" distribution.

<p>
The distribution file names are:

<ul>
  <li>openssl-0.9.6e.tar.gz [normal]
  <li>openssl-engine-0.9.6e.tar.gz [engine]
</ul>

<p>
Yours,<br>
The OpenSSL Project Team...
