  This is the source tree for the www.openssl.org website.  It's entirely
  generated with Photoshop (for images) and Website META Language (WML) (for
  markup).  Never edit any .html files manually. Instead edit the
  corresponding .wml file. To translate the .wml files to the .html files just
  run `wmk'. For more information about WML have a look at
