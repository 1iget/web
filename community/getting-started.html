            <p>We're always looking for people who want to help out.
            Here are some tips to getting started. First, get familiar with
            the information on this page, and the links to the side.
            In particular, you should look at the <a
              href="mailinglists.html">Mailing Lists</a> page and join
            the <em>openssl-dev</em> or <em>openssl-users</em> list, or both.
            After that, here are some ideas:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><em>Look through the open tickets on our ticket system.</em>
              <br/>
              <a
                href="https://rt.openssl.org/NoAuth/Login.html?user=guest&password=guest">https://rt.openssl.org/NoAuth/Login.html?user=guest&amp;password=guest</a>.
              Scan old tickets and offer patches, suggestions on how to
              help fix, or even just point out which ones can be closed.
              You won't be able to edit anything through this interface,
              so if you want to give information on a bug (say it's number
              1234) then send mail to the openssl-dev mailing list, and
              put this text at the start of the Subject line: "[openssl.org
              #1234]" followed by your text.  Plaintext (non-HTML) messages
              are best.  Attachments, such as a proposed patch, are fine.
              That special subject-line prefix will get your message
              connected into the ticket log.
              <p></p></li>

              <li><em>Look through the OpenSSL issues on GitHub.</em>
              <br/>
              You can find issues that people have opened at
              <a
                href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues</a>.
              Sometimes there are open tickets that can be related, it would
              be good to cross-reference them (so somebody working on one,
              sees the other).  Commentary on the issues is also good,
              particularly when an issue should instead be a bug report
              (RT ticket).  Open an RT (email to rt@openssl.org) and reference
              the GitHub issue and then when the ticket is created, update
              the issue with the ticket number.  Again, the whole point is
              to tie issues, PR's, and tickets together so that closing one
              will lead to all the related ones.
              Even just commenting that you think an issue is important is
              very useful!
              <p></p></li>

              <li><em>Look at the pull requests on GitHub.</em>
              <br/>
              You can find pull requests -- patches that people have
              suggested -- at
              <a
                href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pulls">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pulls</a>
              Reviewing and commenting on these is helpful, like with
              the issues mentioned above.
              <p></p></li>

              <li><em>Help update the documentation.</em>
              <br/>
              The documentation has gotten better, but there are still many
              API's that are not documented.  Write a POD page, or report
              bugs in existing pages.  It's probably better to get a whole
              bunch of minor edits done one once.
              <p></p></li>

              <li><em>Write some test cases.</em>
              <br/>
              Simple stand-alone test programs that exercise various API's
              are very useful, and can usually be added to our perl-based
              test framework pretty easily.
              Tests of the command-line program are also important, and
              can be handled by the same framework but might require a bit
              more digging.  We welcome all new test efforts!
              <p></p></li>
