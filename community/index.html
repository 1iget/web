	    The list of <a href="team.html">development team members</a> is
	    available, as is a description of how to
	    <a href="contacts.html">contact us</a> off-line. We'd also like

	    Anyone can join, but you must be a member of a list to post to it.
	    We have a <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org">public wiki</a>,
	    and anyone can request an account and start adding content.
	    We have a <a href="/blog">team blog</a>, where members of
	    the development team will occasionally post.
