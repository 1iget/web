	    OpenSSL is a a collaborative effort of a worldwide community of
            volunteers that has a <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of the ways you can join the
	    community and contribute.
	    The list of <a href="team.html">development team members</a> is
	    available, as is a description of how to
	    <a href="contacts.html">contact us</a> off-line. We'd also like
	    to <a href="thanks.html">thank</a> several groups for help with
	    the project infrastructure over time.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    We maintain several <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>.
	    Anyone can join, but you must be a member of a list to post to it.
	    We have a <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org">public wiki</a>,
	    and anyone can request an account and start adding content.
	    We have a <a href="/blog">team blog</a>, where members of
	    the development team will occasionally post.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    While we only distribute source, some members of the community
	    make <a href="binaries.html">binaries</a> available.

            <h3><a href="#bugs">Reporting Bugs</a></h3>

	    <p>If you think have found a security bug, please see our
	    <a href="/news/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerabilities page</a>
	    for information on how to report it.</p>

	    <p>We have set up a request tracker at
	    <a href="https://rt.openssl.org">https://rt.openssl.org</a>,
	    with read-only access using <em>guest</em> as the name
	    and password.
	    Requests can be viewed on-line by using the following URL,
	    replacing <em>NNNN</em> with the request number:
	    https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;id=<em>NNNN</em>
	    </p>

	    <p>To report a bug or make an enhancement request, send email
	    to <a href="mailto:rt@openssl.org">rt@openssl.org</a>.
	    In the subject line, please make sure to indicate if it's a
	    bug or a fix, and a brief description of the issue.  In the
	    body of your mail, please include the versions of the operating
	    system and OpenSSL you are using.  If you have a patch or diff,
	    please send it as an attachment, and not inline in
	    the message body.</p>

	    <p>The easiest way to respond to an existing request is to reply
	    to the relevant message in <em>openssl-dev@openssl.org</em>.
	    To help avoid duplicate copies, edit the recipient list so that
	    only <em>rt@openssl.org</em> is listed and remove any quoted
	    material.
	    </p>

	    <p>You can also create a pull request in
	    <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">GitHub</a>,
	    but if you do that, please also use RT and refer to the
	    request number.  That way we are less likely to lose track
	    of things.</p>
