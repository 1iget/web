	    <p>In addition to <a href="/community">community</a> support,
	    <a href="/community/contacts.html">OpenSSL Software Services</a>
	    offers three different type of support contract.  If you
	    have specific requirements not addressed by any of these plans,
	    or for more information, discuss custom arrangements.</p>

	    <p>Please see the <a href="#definitions">list of definitions</a>
	    at the bottom of the page for the definitions used below.</p>

	    <dl>
	      <dt><a href="#premium">Premium</a>
	      Enterprise Level Support</dt>
	      <dd>Designed for the large enterprise utilising OpenSSL
	      extensively in product lines or critical infrastructure.</dd>
	      <dt><a href="#vendor"><dt>Vendor</a> Support</dt>
	      <dd>Designed for organisations requiring support of product
	      lines using OpenSSL or for customised in-house versions of
	      OpenSSL.</dd>
	      <dt><a href="#basic"><dt>Basic</a> Support<dt>
	      <dd>Basic technical support for application development shops or
	      end users.</dd>

	    <h3><a name="premium">Premium Level Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$50,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>All technical support requests handled directly by a Designated Responder
	      <li>24x7x365 availability
	      <li>Four Support Administrators
	      <li>Unlimited Service Requests
	      <li>Custom patch preparation and creation
	      <li>OpenSSL FIPS Object Module support included
	      <li>FIPS validation support
	    </ul>
	    <p>The premium support plan is designed for the large enterprise
	    using OpenSSL as an essential component of multiple products or
	    product lines or in support of in-house or commercially provided
	    services. Many prospective Premium Level customers have already
	    hired individual OpenSSL team members for specific tasks. The
	    typical large enterprise customer has a capable in-house technical
	    staff but still finds it cost-effective to engage the world class
	    talent of OpenSSL authors and maintainers.  Customisation of
	    OpenSSL by prospective Schedule A customers is common, as are
	    "private label" FIPS 140-2 validations.</p>
	    <p>Note we don't expect to sell very many of the premium support
	    plans, but those few customers will receive careful attention for
	    both immediate problems and long range strategic interests.</p>

	    <h3><a name="vendor">Vendor Level Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$20,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Institutional Response with escalation to Designated Responder as appropriate.
	      <li>12x5 availability
	      <li>Two Support Administrators
	      <li>Limit of four Service Requests per month
	      <li>Custom patch preparation
	      <li>OpenSSL FIPS Object Module support included
	      <li>FIPS validation support excluded
	    </ul>
	    <p>This plan is designed for the medium enterprise using OpenSSL
	    for a single product or product line. The prospective Vendor Level
	    Support customer has a proficient technical staff but no specific
	    expertise in cryptography or OpenSSL. Technical support is
	    provided for use of the unmodified OpenSSL FIPS Object Module, but
	    not for validations of derivative software.</p>

	    <h3><a name="basic">Basic Support</a></h3>
	    <p>US$10,000 annually</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Institutional Response only
	      <li>8x5 availability
	      <li>One Support Administrator
	      <li>Limit of one unique Service Request per month
	      <li>OpenSSL FIPS Object Module support excluded
	      <li>FIPS validation support excluded
	    </ul>
	    <p>This plan is designed for the medium to small enterprise
	    relying on stock OpenSSL for significant products or services and
	    lacking internal resources for effectively addressing all
	    operational and application development issues.</p>

	    <h3><a name="definitions">Support Terms</a></h3>
	    <dl>
	      <dt>Customer Contacts</dt>
	      <dd>customer personnel familiar with the customer's software
	      environment coordinating technical support correspondence
	      between the customer and OSF personnel for a specific service
	      request.  The Customer Contacts are the sole liaisons for such
	      technical correspondence with the OSF.  It is recommended that
	      the Customer Contacts be knowledgeable about the customer
	      environment and use of the OpenSSL software and have an
	      understanding of the problem for which support services are
	      requested.</dd>

	      <dt>Designated Responder</dt>
	      <dd>All technical support is provided by OpenSSL team members or
	      their close collaborators in the OpenSSL developer community.  A
	      designated responder is an OpenSSL team member directly handling
	      a support request and communicating directly with the Customer
	      Contact.</dd>

	      <dt>Institutional Response</dt>
	      <dd>Technical support correspondence originating or reviewed by
	      one or more OpenSSL team members but communicated indirectly by
	      other OSF personnel.</dd>

	      <dt>Patch Preparation</dt>
	      <dd>The preparation of a patch changeset from existing changes
	      committed to the OpenSSL source code repository.</dd>

	      <dt>Patch Creation</dt>
	      <dd>The coding of new source code modifications or additions not
	      already committed to the OpenSSL source code repository.  The
	      resolution of problems identified in the OpenSSL software itself
	      will generally be resolved by committing the code modifications
	      to the OpenSSL source code repository; such modifications
	      automatically define a patch.  For support plan options custom
	      software modifications may be performed that are specific to the
	      customer environment.  Such custom modifications will not be
	      committed to the publicly available source code repository and
	      will be delivered to the customer as custom patches.</dd>

	      <dt>Service Request</dt>
	      <dd>A specific request for support initiated by a Support
	      Administrator and assigned a service request number by the
	      OSF.</dd>

	      <dt>Support Administrator</dt>
	      <dd>An individual designated by the customer to submit requests
	      for technical support to the OSF.  The number of individuals
	      that can be designated as support administrators varies with the
	      support plan option.  The support administrator may be a
	      Customer Contact in the context of a specific Service Request,
	      or may designate a Customer Contact for Service Requests.</dd>
