<title>Support, Request Tracker</title>

<h1>OpenSSL Request Tracker</h1>

The OpenSSL project has set up a request tracker at
<a href="http://rt.openssl.org/">http://rt.openssl.org/</a>
offering read-only access using the account <tt>guest</tt> with the
password <tt>guest</tt>.

<h2>List of Bugs/Requests</h2>

Please see the
<a href="http://rt.openssl.org/NoAuth/Buglist.html">list</a>
of new or open bugs and requests.

<h2>Sending a Request</h2>

Requests must be sent by email to
<a href="mailto:rt@openssl.org">rt@openssl.org</a>, clearly indicating
the type of request (bug report, patch, contribution, enhancement request,
...) the operating system and version of OpenSSL affected.

<h2>Gateways</h2>

Incoming requests are added to the request tracker. The request tracker
automatically forwards incoming requests to the
<tt>openssl-dev@openssl.org</tt>
mailing list for information of the community and public discussion.
Replys sent to <tt>rt@openssl.org</tt> keeping the ticket in the
subject line unchanged will be recorded and added to the ticket by the
request tracker, then forwarded to <tt>openssl-dev@openssl.org</tt>.

<h2>Disclaimer/Setup</h2>

The request tracker is currently under installation/test, features may change
and malfunctions may occur.

<h2>Request Tracker Software</h2>
The request tracker is using the RT software, available from
<a href="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/">http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/</a>.
