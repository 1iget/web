[General] ========================================================================

* How does this commercialisation impact the OpenSSL mission?

It doesn't.  OpenSSL is not being commercialised and there will *not* be
separate "paid" and "free" versions of the software.

The OpenSSL mission of providing a high quality open source
cryptographic library for use by anyone under a very business friendly license
will not change.  The same OpenSSL team members will continue to improve and
maintain the OpenSSL product for general use as always.

The only commercial aspect that has been introduced is that corporate,
institutional, and government users now have the option of purchasing
commercial software support for the same open source product that is freely
available to everyone.  These paid support subscriptions help support the OpenSSL
team members actively working on the OpenSSL product and so indirectly benefit
the entire user community.

* What is the target market?

We are primarily targeting the commercial vendors with a significant stake in
the OpenSSL product who wish to have an assured level of support and to
sponsor the continued development and maintenance of OpenSSL.  We anticipate
that our typical customer will fit most of the follow criteria: 

a) Is a medium to large software product or services vendor,
b) Uses OpenSSL as an important component of those products or services,
c) Has an interest in the future stability and development of OpenSSL,
d) Has significant on-house technical expertise but recognises that
specialised external support wold be cost-effective

* Why pay for support when I can get it for free?

Why indeed?  If you're satisfied with the extensive support available from the
@@@collaborative community(../community.html)@@@ and the expertise, proficiency, and resource availability of your
current technical staff then this service is not designed for you.

This support contract option is designed for companies that do not have, or
cannot spare, the in-house technical resources for utilising or customising
OpenSSL, who want the assurance that appropriate technical assistance will
be available when needed, and who may not want their technical queries and
discussions seen by the entire world.

* Can we just send a donation instead?

Absolutely, @@@donations(../donations.html)@@@ are welcome and will help make
OpenSSL a better product.  Please note that the OSF is not a qualified
non-profit entity under the U.S. tax code and hence donations from individuals are not
tax-deductible.  We looked into 501(c)(3) tax exemption; it costs more and
takes a long time.  Since our primary purpose is to provide services to the
commercial and government markets and not to solicit charitable
contributions we have elected to defer pursuit of tax exempt status for now.

* Why hasn't this been done before?

Sloth and inertia, basically.  Although the demand for such a service has been
apparent for some time it took a while to work out how to structure a solution
that addressed the legal, financial, and operational issues.

[Plans] =======================================================================

* What is covered by the support plans?

All of the support plans are designed to provide technical assistance with use
of relatively recently released versions of the OpenSSL product for platforms
supported by those versions.  Assistance with using the existing API,
compile/link errors, runtime problem diagnosis, and portability issues for
currently supported platforms would all be covered under the
terms of the support contract.  Porting to completely new platforms,
development of new functionality, or use of OpenSSL in a context clearly not
anticipated at the time of release is not covered by the standard plans.

Merging of bug or vulnerability fixes from a newer release or the development
trunk to an older supported release will *generally* be covered (the exception
being modifications involving significant interface incompatibilities).

* What if we need new features not covered by the support plan?

The incorporation of completely new functionality (new cryptographic
algorithms, implementation of new RFCs, etc.) is not covered.  However, the
OSF can quote a separate development task on a time-and-materials or hourly
rate basis. 

* What about support for FIPS140 and the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module?

The OpenSSL FIPS Object Module validations are based on source code derived
from the baseline OpenSSL product but are not synonymous with that product.
FIPS 140-2 presents some unique challenges transcending the more purely
technical issues of OpenSSL proper.  FPS 140-2 is also of interest to a
relatively small subset of the user community.

The standard support plans will cover operational problems with OpenSSL in "FIPS
compatible" mode but do not cover building of the validated FIPS Object Module
itself.  Support for the FIPS Object Module, including assistance with
building a validated module for a specific platform (if possible) is available
with the Premium plan or as a separate support plan that can be negotiated to
suit your specific requirements.

* Why is there no per-incident support option?

We are a very low overhead organisation with no front office to handle a
significant volume of new customer contacts.  All OSF personnel are
primarily or exclusively dedicated to providing technical services; we could
only support per-incident customers at the expense of the annual support plan
subscribers.  At this point we don't have a feel for the potential demand for
per-incident support and so can't justify the additional staffing such support
may require.  We may reconsider this position at some point

* Will subscribers have an inside track on vulnerability announcements?

The OpenSSL team will not be deliberately withholding any information from the
general open source community for the benefit of paid support plan
subscribers.  We are not changing our mission!

For some types of vulnerabilities the OpenSSL team will work on a fix before
making any public announcement.  Support plan subscribers will not have any
special access to the unannounced details of such vulnerabilities.  However,
we will alert subscribers to the fact that a patch will be required as soon as
we can do so, and will prepare appropriate patches in advance to the extent
our knowledge of your specific situation permits.

[Services] =======================================================================

* What about other types of consulting services?

OpenSSL team members have been providing consulting and custom software
development services on an ad-hoc basis for many years.  In fact, it was the
increasing demand for such services that led to the creation of the OpenSSL
Software Foundation.  Consulting service contracts can be provided on a hourly rate
for one or more OpenSSL team members, or we can prepare a fixed-price proposal
for clearly defined deliverables.

* What is a "private label" validation?

Even though the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module FIPS 140-2 validations were designed for direct
use by commercial software vendors, for various reasons some vendors prefer to obtain
separate validations for their OpenSSL derived software.  That sounds wasteful, and it
is, but in fact the majority of all level 1 FIPS 140-2 validated software products are
based on OpenSSL.  Due to our extensive experience in such validations we can cost-effectively
provide the documentation and CMVP test lab interaction for private label validations.

[Legal and Financial] =======================================================================

* Who or what exactly am I contracting with?

There is no formal legal entity corresponding with the OpenSSL team itself,
which is an informal collaborative association of individuals around the
world.  We created a legal entity to represent the OpenSSL team members
actively participating in the support contract initiative.  That entity, the
OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF) will execute the formal support contract
agreements and handle the associated business functions.  The actual technical
support will be provided by OpenSSL team members.

* Where does the money for support contract subscriptions go?

It all goes to the people directly providing the technical support services
and to current active OpenSSL team members.  There is no investor or parent
company syphoning off revenue for other purposes; the OpenSSL Software
Foundation was created specifically to support the activities of the OpenSSL
team.

Even though not all OpenSSL team members will be directly participating in or directly
benefiting from the support subscription business all have consented to the arrangement
and all will have full access to the financial records (tax
filings and bank statements) of the OSF.

* Are the support plans listed on a GSA schedule?

Sorry, no.  Frankly the paperwork requirements are too intimidating at this
point, and the significant costs of meeting them would have to be passed on
to all of our customers.  Perhaps someday.

[Miscellaneous] =======================================================================

* What if we need help with proprietary or sensitive information?

We recognise that some vendors do not wish to reveal details of their software
products or business plans.  We will respect non-disclosure restrictions
provided such restrictions do not constrain our ability to write and maintain OpenSSL
or other software.

* Why the separate domain name?

We're conducting business using the *opensslfoundation.com* domain name instead
of the *openssl.org* domain name because we
want to distinguish the new for-pay support and service activities from the
traditional OpenSSL project which will continue as before.  We would like
to have used the *openssl.com* domain name but it is taken by someone not
associated with the OpenSSL team.
