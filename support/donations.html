	    <p>Your donation to the OpenSSL team will support the ongoing
	    development activities of the team members.</p>

	    <p>Please note that the
	    <a href="/community/contacts.html">OpenSSL Software Foundation</a>
	    (OSF) is incorporated in the the state of Delaware, United States,
	    as a non-profit corporation.  It does not qualify as a tax-exempt
	    charitable organisation under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S.
	    Internal Revenue Code.  We looked into it and concluded that
	    501(c)(3) status would require more of an investment in time and
	    money than we can justify at present.  This means that, for
	    individuals within the U.S., donations to the OSF are not
	    tax-deductible.  Corporate donations can of course be written off
	    as a business expense.</p>

	    <p>In addition to direct financial contributions in the form of
	    donations or sponsorship you may also support the OpenSSL project
	    financially with the purchase of a
	    <a href="contracts.html"> support contract</a>, or by hiring OSF
	    for consulting services or custom software development.  We
	    consider all sources of funding to be sponsors, because we use all
	    such funding, whether donations or pay for services rendered, for
	    the same purpose -- to improve and maintain the OpenSSL
	    product.</p>
