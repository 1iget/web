	    <p>Our development is maintained in a
	    <a href="gitrepo.html">git repository</a>, which is
	    accessible over the network and cloned on GitHub,
            at <a
              href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">https://github.com/openssl/openssl</a>.

	    <p>The table below lists the latest releases for every branch.
            (For an explanation of the numbering, see our
            <a href="/policies/releasestrat.html">release strategy</a>.)
	    All releases can be found at

	    </p>

	    <p><em>Note:</em> The latest stable version is the 1.1.0 series of
	    releases. Also available is the 1.0.2 series. This is also our Long Term
	    Support (LTS) version (support will be provided until 31st December
	    2019). The 1.0.1 version is currently only receiving security bug fixes
	    and all support will be discontinued for this version on 31st December
	    2016. The 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 versions are now out of support and
	    should not be used.</p>

	    <p>When building a release for the first time, please make sure
	    to look at the README and INSTALL files in the distribution.
	    If you have problems, look at the FAQ, which can also be
	    found <a href="/docs/faq.html">online</a>.</p>

	    <p>
	    Each day we make a snapshot of each development branch.
	    They can be found at
	    <a href="ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/">ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/</a>.
	    These snapshots are provided for convenience only. Note that
            keeping a local repository and updating it every 24 hours is
            equivalent and will often be faster and more efficient.
