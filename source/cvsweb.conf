This is the web interface to the OpenSSL CVS source repository.  You can
browse the file hierarchy by picking directories (which have slashes after
them, e.g. <b>ssl/</b>).  If you pick a file, you will see the revision
history for that file.  Selecting a revision number will download that
revision of the file.  There is a link at each revision to display diffs
between that revision and the previous one, and a form at the bottom of the
page that allows you to display diffs between arbitrary revisions.

Click on a directory to enter that directory. Click on a file to display its
revision history and to get a chance to display diffs between revisions.
